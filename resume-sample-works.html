                <h2>Sample Works</h2>
                <h4>RPG in C#</h4>
                <h5>In my freshman year of high school, I tried to create a role-playing game in C++. I barely
                    understood the language, so it was almost nonfunctional. Now that I am in college, I decided
                    to recreate the game but in C# this time, mostly as a way to learn the language. Currently, I am
                    working on implementing the enemy classes.</h5>

                <h4>FEC Data Application in Clojure</h4>
                <h5>I have been interested in politics for a long time, and campaign finance is an issue close to my
                    heart. When I found out that the FEC (Federal Elections Commission) released an API to pull data
                    about campaign finance, I decided to create an application to allow people to access and manipulate
                    that data. I decided to use Clojure because I was interested in learning a functional language. The process
                    of learning it would be easier than a different functional language, like F#, because Clojure is a JVM language
                    and I would still have access to familiar Java methods and classes. This project is in its beginning stages, so
                    I am still working on making the HTTP requests to pull the data.</h5>
