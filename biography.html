                    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
                    <p>I attend the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. I am currently working towards a Bachelor's
                       Degree in Computer Science. I plan to take Information Internetworks and Systems and Architecture as
                       my Threads for the degree. I am also a part of the Georgia Tech Honors Program.</p>
                    <h3>Personal and Professional Interests</h3>
                    <p>Personally, I like to relax and read books and the news in my spare time. I also like to take walks outside.
                       Professionally, I would like to learn new skills while bettering the ones I already have. Putting my skills
                       to use in the workforce would help me learn more about myself.</p>
                    <h3>Skills</h3>
                    <p>I know the Java, C, and PHP programming languages. I also have some basic knowledge of Python and C#. I also
                       know HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript for web development purposes. I have three certifications from Microsoft - 
                       Microsoft Office Specialist in PowerPoint 2013, Microsoft Technology Associate in Software Development
                       Fundamentals, and Microsoft Technology Associate in Database Administration Fundamentals.</p>
                    <h3>Involvement</h3>
                    <p>I have volunteered in the community over the past four years at nonprofit organizations like Medshare
                       International and Books for Africa. The former repackages good medical supplies that were disposed of in 
                       order to send them to places that need them, while the latter finds good quality literature to send to
                       places in Africa that need it. I plan to continue volunteering while at Georgia Tech.</p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>For the next four years, I plan to finish my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. After I graduate, I
                       might decide to continue on to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science. Whether I do so depends upon
                       the economic situation and if it would help me with career prospects. Alternatively, I might go into 
                       software development/software engineering directly after graduation and see where that takes me.</p>
